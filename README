This is a simple attempt to develop a PhoneGap plugin for the Kal library to present a calendar-driven date picker.

Installation:
* Set up your PhoneGap project
* Add Kal (instructions from https://github.com/klazuka/Kal.git)
* Copy PhoneKal.m and PhoneKal.h into the Plugins group of your project
* Copy PhoneKal.js in your www folder and include it in the pages you need
* To use, invoke
  			window.plugins.PhoneKal.presentPicker(options,function(result) {...});
where options is a dictionary that can have the following keys:
  - initialDate - the date initially selected in the picker
  - title - the title appearing in the navigation bar
